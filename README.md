# Line Follower PID Solution

This repository contains the Simulink model `lineFollower_PID_soln.slx` for a line follower robot using a PID controller.

## Description

The `lineFollower_PID_soln.slx` is a Simulink model that simulates a line follower robot using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The model includes the design and implementation of the PID controller, which is used to adjust the robot's speed and direction based on the line position.

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Control System Toolbox (for PID Controller block)

## Usage

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `lineFollower_PID_soln.slx`.
3. Open `lineFollower_PID_soln.slx` in Simulink.
4. Run the simulation.

Please note that the performance of the line follower robot can be adjusted by tuning the parameters of the PID controller.

## Note

This is a basic line follower model. Depending on the specific requirements of your robot (like the type of sensors used, the configuration of the robot, etc.), you might need to modify the model.
